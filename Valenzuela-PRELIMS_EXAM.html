      <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
        I'm a second-year student studying Information Technology at Ateneo De Naga University. I really believe</br>
        in myself and my ability to do things. My time at Ateneo De Naga has taught me a lot of technical stuff, </br>
        but it's also made me more responsible and determined.Studying Information Technology has made me solve </br>
        tricky problems with new ideas. I've gotten better at programming, analyzing data, and designing systems</br> 
        through tough classes and projects. But it's not just about being good at technical stuff, I've also grown</br>
        because I believe in myself. I think having confidence in myself, along with working hard and staying dedicated,</br>
        is what helps me succeed. This belief has guided me through my studies, making me want to do my best in everything.</br>
        Whether it's dealingwith tough assignments or working with classmates on projects, I always try my hardest and stay positive.</br>
